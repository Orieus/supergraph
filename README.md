**RDIgraphs** is a generic software for the management and processing of a interrelated collection of multiple graphs. 

It was initially conceived for the processing of multiple corpus of scientific publications, patents and project proposals, inside the project "**Service for Identifying Impact and R&D&I Agent Collaboration Networks**" (*Servicio para Identificar Impacto y Redes de Colaboración de Agentes I+D+i*), funded by the **Secretary of State for the Digital Agenda** (SEAD, Secretaría de Estado para la Agenda Digital), under the umbrella of the Spanish Plan for the Stimulus of Language Tecnologies (PTL, [*Plan de Impulso de las Tecnologías del Lenguaje*](https://www.plantl.gob.es/Paginas/index.aspx)).

However, the whole sofware package has a general purpose. It can be used to process multiple graphs. Functionality include (but it is not limited to):

1. **Similarity graphs**: generated from node attributes, based on different similarity measures (Jensen-Shannon, Hellinger, L1, L2).
    * General implementations based on the `neighbors` module from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
    * Specific implementation for fast computation of Hellinger distances using [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) and cuda.
2. **Community detection** algorithms (Louvain, Walktrap, FastGreeedy, Label Propagation)
    * Implementations based on [IGraph](https://igraph.org/python/) and [Networkx](https://networkx.github.io/).
3. **Bipartite** graphs from attributes
4. **Transductive graphs**: Graphs generated by connecting target nodes from a bipartite graph. Link weights are computed from the links of a graph connecting the source nodes.
5. **Transitive graphs**, computed as the composition of two bipartite graphs.
6. **Analysis of graph partitions**.
7. **Analysis of graph nodes** (centrality measures, PageRank).
    * Implementations based on [Networkx](https://networkx.github.io/).
8. **Edicion tools** for the collection of graphs:
    * Create, add, remove graphs
    * Subsampling
    * Reduction to graphs of equivalence classes
9. **Tools for visualization**:
    * Graph layout algorithms.
    * Exportation to GEXF format
    * Visualization of bipartite graphs (requires [Halo](https://vizuly.io/product/halo/), not included)
        

## Usage:

### As an application:

The software includes two applications that can be used to generate and manipulate graphs through an interactive menu:

* `mainRDIgraphs.py`: Provides accces to the sofware functionality through an interative menu. It reads the links to the source data from a configuration file (`parameters.yaml`). You would need to edit this file to use other data.
* `mainRDIlab.py`: This is a specific application for the SEAD project. It uses the software functionality to carry out experiments for analysing RDI corpus collections.

Write

    python mainRDIgraphs.py --h
    python mainRDIlab.py --h

to see the available options.
   
### As a sofware package:

The software include several class packages that can be used independently. Classes include (and are not limited to):

   * `SimGraph`: Generation of similarity graphs
   * `CommunityPlus`: Wrapper to community detection algorithms
   * `DataGraph` (requires `SimGraph` and `CommunityPlus`): provides tools for graph processing and analysis.
   * `SuperGraph` (requires `DataGraph`): provides tools for handling collections of DataGraph objects, including tools for the generation of new datagraphs.
